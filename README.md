##  On Duality of Stability and Capacity Regions in Interference Networks
These simulation codes are evaluated the results of the paper. Our simulations are done in Python through "Jupyter Notebook" software and each simulation code has two .csv files which represent the packet movement rules between queues.\
Simulation Codes contain following results:\

### Non-Homogeneous Channel setting
Ordinary Procedure \
Modified Procedure ( We do the simulation for Corner point B and it is similar for Corner point A)

### Stable Throughput Region When Capacity Region Is Unkown
Ordinary Procedure\
Modified Procedure

### XOR Operations

### Packet Lifetime

NOTE: In ordinary procedure, we consider the arriving rates with step length =0.001. It is important to note that we can insert the arriving rates manulally due to the long simulation time.
