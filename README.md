##  On Duality of Stability and Capacity Regions in Intermittent Interference Networks
These simulation codes are evaluated the results of the paper. Our simulations are done in Python through "Jupyter Notebook" software.\
Simulation Codes contain following results:\
1- Non-Homogeneous Channel Setting\
2- Stable Throughput Region When Capacity Region Is Unkown.

### Non-Homogeneous Channel setting
Ordinary Procedure \
Modified Procedure ( We do the simulation for Corner point B and it is similar for Corner point A)

### Stable Throughput Region When Capacity Region Is Unkown
Ordinary Procedure\
Modified Procedure

### XOR Operations
### Packet Lifetime

NOTE: Every code has two .csv files which represent the packet movement rules between queues.
